# Information-leakage-detection-and-prevention
In today’s highly interconnected digital landscape, safeguarding sensitive information during data sharing and distribution has become a critical concern. The project titled "Information Leakage Detection and Prevention" addresses the escalating risks of unauthorized access, insider threats, and accidental data exposure in distributed environments. As organizations increasingly rely on cloud services, third-party integrations, and remote access, the need for proactive and traceable security mechanisms is more pressing than ever.

This project introduces a multi-layered security framework that integrates fake object injection, key-based encryption, multi-level authentication, and behavioral analysis to ensure data confidentiality and traceability. Fake objects, or decoy data, are embedded within datasets to act as digital tripwires—triggering alerts upon unauthorized access and helping identify the source of a breach. The system uses a custom KeyGen algorithm to assign unique encryption keys to each data segment, ensuring that only verified users can decrypt and access the information. Continuous user validation and access behavior monitoring enhance accountability and allow for real-time anomaly detection.

By combining detection and prevention strategies, the system provides a robust defense against both internal and external threats. It ensures secure data flow across distributed systems without compromising performance or usability. The project demonstrates a scalable and resilient solution for information leakage prevention, setting the groundwork for future advancements in secure data distribution and intelligent breach response systems.
